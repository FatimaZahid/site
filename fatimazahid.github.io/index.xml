      <description>I am currently studying Computer Science. I am a coder, web developer. I have interests in graphic designing as well. Cloud Computing was somehow field of my interest, but now I have lost the passion in this field and hence, I am much more inclined towards software developing. Here I have this website of mine for the same purpose. As far as my personal interests are concerned, I love reading articles, and thatâ€™s it!</description>

      <description>Initially x86 compatible OS was created which is referred to as MultiBoot 2 compliant. This OS had been primarily written in C language. Assembly was also used for some specifications. Docker had provided a building environment through built images. Dockerfile was generated. This file was involving all the items I needed to build an image. Then a container was opened through the running command of Docker on Windows, as I used windows for this purpose.</description>

      <description>Some of the errors encountered during recompilations are:
 In the beginning, Docker file should be named as Dockerfile not DockerFile, or any other format, as I have faced this error. Then I have encountered an error that it was taking too long to install required files to build an image. It took about 2 hours but then ended up with an error for loading meta data for docker. The reason was poor internet connection.</description>
